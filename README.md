This program will read two integers from a file called “boundries.txt”. 
Then you will implement a function that will find primes and semi-primes between the two integers (Both ends are included) 
(Semi-prime number is a number that have only two prime divisor). \n
You will print the results into a file called, “primedistribution.txt”. \n
For example: for given the input file that contains 2 and 10 we expect your output as follows:
2 is Prime
3 is Prime
4 is Semi-prime
5 is Prime
6 is Semi-prime
7 is Prime
9 is Semi-prime
